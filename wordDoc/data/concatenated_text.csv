STAFF GRIEVANCE AND DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES

The objective of the Grievance and Disciplinary Procedures is to provide clear structures for dealing with difficulties that may arise as part of the working relationship, from either the employer’s or employee’s perspective.

These procedures are needed to ensure every individual is treated equally in similar circumstances and to deal with issues fairly and reasonably. It also ensures that employees comply with the current local and ASW code of conduct.


STAFF GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE

Step One
Any staff who has a grievance may, within 1 week of its arising, bring the matter to the attention of his immediate supervisor or, where such grievance is against his immediate supervisor, to the attention of his supervisor’s manager, who shall give his decision within 1 week from the date of reference to him.

Step Two
If the staff concerned is aggrieved by the decision given under Step 1, he may within 1 week thereof, refer the matter to his Head of Department for settlement, who shall give his decision within 1 week from the date the matter was referred to him.

Step Three
If the staff is still dissatisfied with the decision given under Step 2, the staff may refer the matter to the HR Manager, who will represent the Management for settlement. In the event of there being no settlement at the above steps, the matter shall be dealt with by the Head HR/MD, whose decision shall be final.


DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE

It is the responsibility of the immediate supervisors to ensure their staff are treated equally and, rules and regulations are enforced fairly and consistently following established guidelines.

The immediate supervisor is to administer disciplinary actions in response to undesirable staff attitudes and/or behaviours that adversely affect the Company’s interest. The staff should be given a clear indication and proof of where they are failing or the rules and regulations they have broken.

Except for gross misconduct, the staff should be given an opportunity to improve before disciplinary action is taken against them.

In any case, the staff should be allowed to state their case.
It is always necessary to consult the HR Department before taking any disciplinary action except counselling and verbal Warning.

It is the responsibility of the immediate supervisor to maintain proper documentation of disciplinary actions taken and to forward a copy to the HR Department.

The disciplinary action given to the staff should be demonstrated fairly and consistently with previous actions in similar circumstances.


Stages of Disciplinary Actions

Counselling

The immediate supervisor will counsel the staff to improve their work performance, undesirable attitude and/or behaviour.

If the staff have improved their performance, the immediate supervisor shall conduct a concluding session to inform them that their performance improvement has been noted and that the disciplinary process will be ceased.

However, should the staff continue to exhibit undesirable attitude and/or behaviour, or their performance deteriorates during or after the review period, the immediate supervisor should proceed to the next step of the disciplinary process - issue a verbal warning.

It is up to the discretion and judgement of the immediate supervisor to determine a fair duration of the review period. E.g. at least 2 months.

Verbal Warning
If there is no improvement after the counselling session, the immediate supervisor can issue a verbal warning. This must be documented and a copy to be sent to the HR Department.

Verbal Warning can also be issued to the staff for minor misconduct or persistent unsatisfactory performance within ONE WEEK of the offence committed.

Written Warning
If the staff commit the same misconduct OR continue to have unsatisfactory performance after the verbal warning given OR commit a major misconduct, the immediate supervisor shall issue a written warning to them. The recurrence or accumulation of similar offences will lead to more severe disciplinary action.

Final Warning
A Final Warning shall be issued within ONE WEEK if the staff committed the same misconduct OR having unsatisfactory performance after a Written Warning was given OR they have committed a major misconduct.

The immediate supervisor should state clearly the offence committed on the final warning letter to the staff.

Both supervisor and staff are required to sign and acknowledge the written warning letter. If the staff refuse to sign and acknowledge the warning letter, the supervisor shall indicate the reason on the warning letter. A copy of the warning letter should be given to the staff, HR Department and the immediate supervisor.

The immediate supervisor is required to keep track of the performance of the staff and review with them regularly.

Suspension (with/without pay)
If staff are involved in any breach of Conditions of Service or committed a major misconduct, they may be suspended from duty pending further investigation.

HR will issue a letter to the staff to inform them of the reason and period of suspension.


Staff may be suspended from duty on half pay for a period not exceeding 7 days. Depending on the outcome of the investigation, appropriate action will be taken against the staff, such as reinstatement of duty if found innocent, warning given, termination, dismissal, etc.

If the suspended staff are dismissed, they will be paid for the days they  have worked, excluding the period of suspension.

If the Company has instituted criminal proceedings, the staff’s service will be dismissed.

If the Police has instituted criminal proceeding for acts outside the Company’s business activities, the services of the staff may be suspended, depending on the circumstances of the case until the conclusion of criminal proceeding.

Immediate supervisor is required to provide all relevant details to the HR Department before the decision to suspend is taken.

Immediate Dismissal
Staff could be summarily dismissed without notice or payment if they commit gross misconduct or negligence.

Annual leave will be forfeited and payment-in-lieu of notice is not required  for dismissal cases.

Approval from the HR department is needed for all dismissal cases.

Demotion

If staff continue to have unsatisfactory performance, they might be downgraded to a lower position, in consultation with the HR department.

Records of counselling and/or warnings have to be presented to support the case.

Salary will be revised to commensurate with the new job position and scope.

A warning should remain in force in accordance with the following stages from the date of issue:

Counselling	-	3 months
Verbal Warning	-	6 months
Written Warning   -	12 months
Final Warning	-	18 months

If the staff feel that the disciplinary action taken against them are unfair, they may invoke the Grievance Procedure.

Disciplinary action should follow a natural progression from less severe to more severe in order to convey a clear message that undesirable attitudes and/or behaviour cannot be condoned. However, in cases where a major offence is committed, the disciplinary action need not follow the natural progression.


Inquiry Procedure

Immediate supervisor is to inform and submit a report of offence to the next higher level manager and the HR Department. The Loss Prevention Department should be informed if the offence is criminal or major/grave.

For cases that are criminal in nature, a police report will be made by Loss Prevention Department.

Depending on the severity and impact of the offence, the staff may be suspended from work on half pay up to a week pending investigation and inquiry outcome. The HR Department will issue the suspension letter.

The Loss Prevention Department will assist in the investigation and abide by the timeline of one week to conclude the investigation.

The result of the investigation and recommendation from Loss Prevention Department will be forwarded to the HR Department for follow-up.

The grounds upon which it is intended to take disciplinary action against the staff should be framed as a definite charge or charges and conveyed to the staff in a written notice that specifies the date, time and place of inquiry.

Reasonable time should be given before the inquiry to enable the staff to prepare their case.

The inquiry is to be conducted as far as possible by persons not directly connected with the events of the misconduct so as to give the hearing impartiality. It should generally comprise 3 persons – at least one from the Department and one from the HR Department. The panel members must not have a direct working relationship with the staff in question.

If the staff is absent on the inquiry date for good reasons (sudden illness, accident etc. supported by documentary evidence), the inquiry should be adjourned to another date. The staff should then be served with a fresh notice on the date, place and time of the inquiry. If the staff absent themselves the second time, then the proceedings will be heard ex-parte, unless the staff have given prior notice (with good reasons) that they would be unable to attend the inquiry.

All witnesses should be examined in the presence of the staff in respect of the charges. They should be given a fair opportunity to cross-examine and to put up their defence by calling their witnesses, including themselves, if they so wish.

Notes should be recorded.

After the inquiry, the Inquiry Officer must consider the evidence and record the conclusion and reasons. Findings in writing are to submit to the Head of Department and HR.

The Head of Department will, in consultation with the HR Department, decide on the appropriate action and convey the decision expeditiously to the staff.

In line with Workplace Safety and Health Act, Company intends to provide and maintain a safe work environment for all staff by ensuring adequate safety measures are taken at work.

Maintain good housekeeping at own work station and department at all times;
Always keep the work station and passageway free of litters;

For any accidents that occurred at the workplace on the employees, an Incident Report Form must be submitted to the Human Resource Department within 1 working day of the accident, where possible.


WHISTLE BLOWING POLICY

In line with our commitment, we encourage staff with serious concerns about any violation of the Code of Business Ethics or Conduct or any laws to come forward, in good faith and voice their concerns.

This policy makes it clear that staff can do so without fear of reprisals. It is intended to encourage and enable staff to raise serious concerns within the Company rather than overlooking a problem or blowing the whistle outside the Company. This policy offers different channels for staff to raise their concerns and to receive feedback on actions taken.

It is important to note that this policy shall not be used for reporting personal complaints or unsatisfactions which are not resulting from a malpractice, misbehaviour or a fraudulent action from a staff or management team.

If staff suspect anyone violates the Code of Business Ethics or Conduct or the Local Law, they may report to:

Loss Prevention Manager, John Sim @  or HR Manager, Neo Shu Fen @  or HR Manager, Elyssa Lee @ 

OR

For ease of submission, the Whistleblowing Form has been made available via KNOW app

OR

General Manager, GMS, CKHH, at 

If staff are not satisfied with the investigation by the above people, they could complain about the handling of investigation to be handled by Group Head of Regulatory at whistleblowing-complaints@aswatson.com.
Although no proof is required, staff who do the reporting will need to demonstrate that there are sufficient grounds for concern and report the violations within 24 hours. The Company is committed to acknowledging incoming cases within 48 hours.

Concerns expressed anonymously are less powerful, and therefore the Company does not encourage anonymous reporting, although it reckons that in some exceptional circumstances, staff will prefer anonymity. Staff are protected against retaliation of reporting any violations if they have reasonable belief at the time of reporting.

The Company will do its best to protect staff’s identity when raising concerns. However, there may be circumstances in which the Company may be required to reveal the identity of the staff voicing the concern. The report and identity will be treated confidentially and only shared on a “need to know” basis. If this is the case, the Company will take all reasonable steps to ensure that the staff suffer no detrimental consequences.


SALARY PAYMENT

rate of pay for one day’s work.

Store:
If a full-time Customer Supervisor and below is required to work on a public holiday, he will receive an extra day’s pay for every gazetted public holiday. This is provided the employee does not absent himself from work on the working day immediately before or after a public holiday without his superior’s consent. However, the Management still reserves the right to revert to the option of crediting a day off in lieu and employees will be notified accordingly.

A monthly-rated employee who works on a public holiday but absents without reason on the working day immediately before or after the holiday is not entitled to the holiday pay which is already included in his monthly gross salary. Company can therefore deduct one day's pay at the gross rate for the holiday pay from his monthly gross salary.
